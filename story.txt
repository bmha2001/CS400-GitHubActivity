Jiangang Chen:
  On Saturday, I ate a sandwich and mike in the morning. Then I made some Moon cake with my roommate for the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is in the Oct.1. Mid-Autumn Festival is a traditional Chinese Festival that people will stay with their family and friends to watch the moon with some snacks. The moon on that day will be the largest and roundest in a year. Hopefully, the weather on that day will be nice. How about your day?
  
On my Saturday I woke up very late because I am recovering from an illness. I did not wake up until 3pm. When I did awake I made myself eggs for breakfast. I then proceeded to work on homework for the upcoming week. Later I worked out and then hung out with friends for the rest of the night. How about your day?
